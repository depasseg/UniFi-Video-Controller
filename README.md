# Important
Starting with Unifi Video 3.8.0, port 7442 is required for secure communication between the nvr and camera. Cameras that update their firmware will *not* be able to connect until `-p 7442:7442` is added to the run command.

Starting with Unifi Video 3.9.2, cameras will update their firmware to 4.2.13 which is incompatible with earlier releases. If your cameras upgrade and you want to use an earlier version, you'll have to manually downgrade.

# unifi-video-controller

This docker image runs the unifi-video controller on Ubuntu. Originally intended for Unraid 6.x, it should run fine anywhere.

Set your local data and videos directories in the `docker run` command. You can also specify a UID and GID for the daemon to run as.

Restart the docker, visit http://localhost:7080 or http://<ip.address>:7080/ to start the Unifi Video wizard.

# Run it
```
docker run \
        --name unifi-video \
        --cap-add SYS_ADMIN \
        --cap-add DAC_READ_SEARCH \
        -p 10001:10001 \
        -p 1935:1935 \
        -p 6666:6666 \
        -p 7080:7080 \
        -p 7442:7442 \
        -p 7443:7443 \
        -p 7444:7444 \
        -p 7445:7445 \
        -p 7446:7446 \
        -p 7447:7447 \
        -v <data dir>:/var/lib/unifi-video \
        -v <videos dir>:/var/lib/unifi-video/videos \
        -e TZ=America/Los_Angeles \
        -e PUID=99 \
        -e PGID=100 \
        -e DEBUG=1 \
        --restart unless-stopped \  
        pducharme/unifi-video-controller
```

# Changing versions

Starting with 3.9.0, releases are tagged. Using `pducharme/unifi-video-controller` or `pducharme/unifi-video-controller:latest` will get you the latest version. You can get a different version by using a specific tag, like `:3.9.0`, `:3.9.2` or `3.9.3`. If you update and have issues, you can quickly switch back to the previously working version.

#  tmpfs mount error

```
mount: tmpfs is write-protected, mounting read-only
mount: cannot mount tmpfs read-only
```

If you get this tmpfs mount error, add `--security-opt apparmor:unconfined \` to your list of run options. This error has been seen on Ubuntu, but may occur on other platforms as well.

# Starting and Stopping

Once the `unifi-video` container has been deployed, you can check the status by running `sudo docker ps -a`.  It can be stopped with `sudo docker stop unifi-video` and started with `sudo docker start unifi-video`.

# Updating

The image can be updated by running `docker images |grep -v REPOSITORY|awk '{print $1}'|xargs -L1 docker pull` and then restarted with `sudo docker restart unifi-video`.
